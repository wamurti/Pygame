A small pygame
Small educational group project on learning python and pygame, by students at Nackademin, Solna, Sweden.
It's a mess but was fun to create, and learn.

Play from main.py and make sure to have sound on. 
Use the up/down/left/right-keys to move, and shoot arrows with the space-key. You get points when destroying fireballs with your arrow and when you clear the game by reaching the top of the screen, at which poit the game is over.


Concept inspired by Gain Ground.
